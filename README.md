# C64_Wifi_Modem_Abg
Commodore 64 Wifi Modem with ESP8266 on NodeMCU

This build is a modification of: https://github.com/RolandJuno/esp8266_modem

...which is based on: https://github.com/jsalin/esp8266_modem

Modifcations I performed:
+ Display using OLED 128x64 with the Adafruit GFX and SSD1306 libraries.
+ Speaker for the authentic retro sound... DTMF dialing, carrier, and connection burst of data.
